In this part, We use FineTuning technique to update Pretrained Models for classifying Teeth Diseases.

PreTrained Models are used: 

    1- VGG16 : Val accuracy up to 85 %
  
    2- ResNet18 : very susceptible to overfitting with this dataset!!
    
    3- Inception ModelV3 :Very robust in training , Val accuracy up to 85 %

  We'll continue to work on other models
